**The AeroScapes Semantic Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 3269 images with 18897 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *background*, *vegetation*, *road*, and other: *person*, *obstacle*, *construction*, *bike*, *car*, *sky*, *drone*, *animal*, and *boat*. There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2621 images) and *val* (648 images). Alternatively, images could be split into 141 video sequences: ***seq1***, ***seq2***, etc. The dataset was released in 2018 by the Carnegie Mellon University.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 12 classes:
